### k8s in Production

---

When we choose to use k8s as orchestrator, then we need to choose the vendors for it.

We can go either `Cloud Managed Solution` like `GCP`, `AWS`, `Azure`, `Digital Ocean` etc. We can also choose self managed distribution like, `Docker Enterprise`, `Rancher`, `OpenShift`, `Canonical`, `VMWARE PKS` etc.
