### Ingress Service

---

When it comes to ingress service in k8s, there are two options we have to consider,

1. [kubernetes-ingress](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress): Maintained by the `Nginx` company itself.
2. [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx): A community driven project.

Difference between them are discussed [here](https://github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress/blob/master/docs/nginx-ingress-controllers.md).
